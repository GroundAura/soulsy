    <Description>Soulsy is a fast, lightweight, themable Souls-style hotkey HUD for Skyrim SE and
        AE. It is inspired by hotkey mods like Elden Equip, iEquip, and espcially LamasTinyHud. It's
        implemented as a SKSE plugin with only enough papyrus to make MCM go.

        You can design your own layouts and themes, or choose one from this installer. There are two
        icon packs and two themes in addition to the default ones.</Description>
